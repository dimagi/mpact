Creating a new chat group
=========================

#. In Telegram, open the menu and choose "New Group".
#. Add the bot to the group. It will not appear as a contact. You will
   need to type its username (the same username as the BOT_USERNAME
   environment variable).
#. Give your new group a name, and press the check mark to create the
   group.
#. Press the group name to see its members.
#. Long-press on the bot and select "Promote to Admin", otherwise the
   bot will be unable to see any messages from other members.

The bot will be notified of its new group, and the group will be added
to the database. The next time you refresh the page or log into mPACT,
the group will appear in the left panel.
