Individual chats
================

In order to engage with participants one-on-one, the participant must
first message the bot directly. In order to do that, they can ...

#. Press the bot's name to open their details
#. Press the "message" icon
#. Send a message

The interface will not show a separate chat for the participant
immediately. The next time you refresh the page or log into mPACT,
an individual chat with the participant will appear in the left panel.

After that, messages from participants will appear as they are sent.
